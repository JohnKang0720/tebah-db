MySQL CRUD Application to manage the hierarchical set of TEBAH church members and families.
The application uses SQL to query important information as well as create meaningful relationships between datas of Tebah pastors, missionaries, members and youths using JOINS and CTEs.
SQL is connected with Node.js and Express to handle client requests and results, while React.js is used to display important information to the users.
